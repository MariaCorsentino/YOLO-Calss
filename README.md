# YOLO-Class
 This is for the YOLO class.
 
For the Take-Home assignment, I created Python code using Colab and the following steps:
1.  Implemented YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN models for object detection, comparing their performance across five images in terms of objects detected, confidence scores, and detection times.
2. Annotated and visualized images with bounding boxes and labels, saving both raw detection results and annotated images for further analysis.
3. Extracted additional features (color histograms and edge detection) using OpenCV to complement deep learning-based object detection.
4. Organized the project into a workflow using Colab, created structured outputs (CSV files, images) and documentation for GitHub.
